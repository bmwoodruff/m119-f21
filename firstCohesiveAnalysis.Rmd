## Evaluating the function $f(x) = x^2$.

```{r}
f <- function(x){x^2}
```

We can evaluate the funtion $$f(x)=2$$ (using $\LaTeX$) at $x=3$ to obtain `r f(3)`, as shown below. 

```{r }
f(3)
```

Note that we can easily change this to $x=5$ to obtain $f(5) = `r f(5)`$, shown below. 

```{r }
f(5)
```
 
 Notice that there are sentences introducing every bit of code, explaining how it belongs to the rest of the work.
